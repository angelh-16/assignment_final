# HHA504 Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to design a small, realistic healthcare cloud solution that integrates multiple services we have used this fall semester (e.g., storage, compute, databases, AI/analytics, containers/serverless)

### Design:
Produce a clear **solution architecture and implementation plan** that shows how you would use cloud services together to solve a specific healthcare problem.

### Concrete healthcare scenario: 
A simple patient intake and triage app for a clinic
